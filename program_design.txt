*** PROGRAM DESIGN ***

Organizing the structure of files and functions.

Must have:
- Interface
- exporting games into separate files (database)
- displaying the chessboard along game status on the side
- implement all chess rules

Basic data type: char array

Representation of pieces and pawns:
p - pawn
R - rook
N - knight
B - bishop
K - King
Q - queen

To add color functionality we might use separate array and
store there the pieces and pawns colors.
We can perform exactly the same elements swaps and this way
change the color of terminal characters, like below:

I.E. display white pawn (print as red):
check the position in the color array
set the particular color (red, blue or none[don't change])
print the piece array character
change the terminal color to default (white), which
should be set at the beginning of the program
