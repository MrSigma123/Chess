MOVES (functions):
- King
- Queen
- Rook
- Bishop
- Knight
- Pawn (two functions because of different pawn move directions for white and black)
  [and different promotions rank and special double initial move ranks]
  [if the pawn moves from the starting square recognize it by checking the starting row
  and allow for double forward move]

MOVE INPUT ALGORITHM:
1. piece letter (i.e. N)
2. starting coordinate (i.e. b2)
3. finishing coordinate (i.e. c3)

CASTLING:
- check if the king was ever moved
- check if any of the squares in castling range squares which king crosses are occupied by opponent
- check if the rook which take part in castling was ever moved
- check if the king is in check
- check if there are no pieces between the rook and the king which take part in the castling

PROMOTION:
- check if the piece reached the rank on the opposite side of the board
  [its 8th rank for the white and 1st rank for the black[]

PROGRAM MODES:
- two player mode
- "silly" CPU mode (with color selection or random)

CHECK: -> pieces range
- add the flags which will mark the pieces range and the flag when the king is checked
- mark checked king square with yellow color

MATE: -> combination of check and occupied surrounding squares
- add the flag for mate
- mark the mated king square with red color

  pieces range:
  - it has to be marked on every field with the array indexes
  - every piece range and blocked range by the other piece has to be marked in array
 
 possible moves:
 - consider adding functionality of displaying possible moves

 game recording:
 - saving the game into the file, to display the game it will have to be displayed
   on the right side of the board or below, it'll be more difficult to display the
   moves on the right, but it would be much more readable

 display annotated moves:
 - along saving the game into the file save the move and display it next to the board,
   the move will be saved as a string

PIECES RANGE: 
- we can use pointers, which will refer to te certain piece, which takes that square
  EXAMPLE: let's take a bishop, which occupies b4 square while standing on c3

CHECKMATE:
- after getting checkmate or giving checkmate the game should be stopped and exported into the file
- the moves input has to be stopped as well
