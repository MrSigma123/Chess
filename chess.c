  GOAL: Fully functional chess for two players or very easy CPU opponent

  - implement all pieces moves
  - castling (probably would be most challenging)
  - pawn promotion
  - en passant
  - consider move highlighting

  - design the chessboard representation

  - for future releases - expand the program core with GUI with different
    languages and packages*/
